AWS ACM does not provide direct export functionality. 
If you originally imported the certificate into ACM, you should have the original files (certificate, private key, and certificate chain). 
If you created the certificate using AWS ACM, you will not be able to export the private key, 
You will need to use the original source of the certificate (e.g., the CA that issued it).
